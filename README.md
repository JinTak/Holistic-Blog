# Holistic-Blog

<h1> Healthy Blog / E-Commerce Website</h1>

<h2> We are building a responsive full stack website in 1-week sprint timeline.   </h2>
<h2> The idea behind this is to accommodate the potential user to post, comment and buy a healthy product. At the same token, we are trying to encourage the user to live the holistic lifestyle. </h2>
